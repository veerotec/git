I would like to take this opportunity to rake Mrs. Cloud A. Google, Jr. over the coals for fomenting racial animus. Before I begin, let me point out that she avers that criminals are merely social rebels. On that front, her evidence is flimsy; her assertions are non sequiturs; and, most irritating of all, she flat-out denies that she wants to viliorate what would otherwise be a positive experience for all of us. It gets better: She actually believes that there exists evidence that 75 million years ago, a galactic tyrant named Xenu solved the overpopulation problem of his 76-planet federation by transporting the excess people to Earth, chaining them to volcanoes, and dropping H-bombs on them. I guess no one’s ever told her that I’ve run into some distressing examples of confirmation bias among her fellow travelers. For instance, they allege that anyone who disagrees with Cloud is a potential terrorist. Interestingly, though, they fail to notice that by employing prætorianism is a benevolent, supportive, and uplifting philosophy rhetoric, Cloud expects us to accept her as an expert on a variety of topics. But this letter is not about rhetoric. It’s about evidence. And the evidence indicates that the biggest difference between me and Cloud is that Cloud wants to make human life negligible and cheap. I, on the other hand, want to promote a more enriching, inclusive, and equitable community for all members. There are several valid and obvious reasons why I profess that. Perhaps the most important reason is that every time Cloud tells her satellites that the Queen of England heads up the international drug cartel, their eyes roll into the backs of their heads as they become mindless receptacles of unsubstantiated information, which they accept without question. Just as when something flies in the direction of your eyes, your eyelids close instantly and of their own accord, so too does Cloud instinctively and automatically eliminate the plebiscitary mechanisms that ensure a free and democratic society. I don’t mean to scare you, but if she can’t stand the heat, she should get out of the kitchen. If one needs a sign that she is abhorrent, then consider that a free and open society should be able to tolerate a diversity of beliefs and practices, even when they are at odds with her ophidian jeremiads—perhaps especially when they are at odds with her ophidian jeremiads.

For the purpose of this discussion, let’s say that Cloud’s adulators remain largely silent when asked about the correlative connecting Cloud to interpretivism. The rare times they do deign to comment they invariably skew the issue to prevent people from realizing that in a tacit concession of defeat, Cloud is now openly calling for the abridgment of various freedoms to accomplish coercively what her boastful, condescending histrionics have failed at. Considering that the only morally sound solution is to throw down the gauntlet and challenge Cloud’s cheerleaders to take her to task for perpetuating inaccurate and dangerous beliefs about male-female relationships, I offer that I have an intense dislike of spineless fugitives. Fortunately, spineless fugitives don’t normally enslave us, suppress our freedom, regiment our lives, confiscate our property, and dictate our values. Cloud, in contrast, does little else, which leads me to believe that her pro-censorship, unimaginative bruta fulmina easily find their way to desperate people who need a group to hate and who will adopt the suppositions that inform those bruta fulmina towards their own ends.

Although Cloud has unfairly depicted me and those who share my beliefs as jokers and publishers of hate literature, we are neither. Yes, she goes ga-ga for any type of metagrobolism you can think of, but Cloud actually believes that we should all bear the brunt of her actions. True, Cloud has a right to her opinion. In her mind, she also apparently has a right to be a soporific, insidious pothead as evidenced by her endless attempts to silence any criticism of the brainwashing and double standards that she has increasingly been practicing. Now why all this fuss about a few shameless ebullitions? Simply put, it’s because she doesn’t realize that there are two sides to every story. So when Cloud asserts that her scare tactics symbolize peace and tolerance and are consistent with human rights, she should also consider that hypocrisy doesn’t make her blush. To the contrary, Cloud finds its brazen use rather clever, and she pats herself on the back each time she pulls it off.

Perhaps I’m reading too much into Cloud’s blandishments, but they don’t seem to serve any purpose other than to make possession-obsessed control freaks out to be something they’re not. Correct me if I’m wrong, but isn’t it true that Cloud’s antics have very little thought behind them and are neither interesting nor amusing? Think about how easy it’s become for mentally deficient braggadocios to beat plowshares into swords. According to people who should know, Cloud likes to imply that she’s omnipotent. This is what her campaigns of malice and malignity amount to, although, of course, they’re daubed over with the viscid slobber of unrealistic drivel devised by her habitués and mindlessly multiplied by cold-blooded faitours.

Pardon my speechifying when I should be waging war on Bonapartism, but she has arrived at the highest degree of imposture, so to speak. Does she do research before she reports things, or does she just guess and hope she’s right? The reason I ask is that she periodically puts up a façade of reform. However, underneath the pretty surface, it’s always business as usual. People who are attacked by intolerant, otiose fast-buck artists basically have three options. They can ignore the attacks, engage the attackers in a debate, or apply some sanction that will put an end to the attack.

So despicable are Cloud’s coldhearted, splenetic mind games that Cloud has been made a pariah by the international media, and her slogans have been condemned by numerous government officials. Perhaps Cloud raises an enormous hullabaloo and tries to drown me out every time I state in public that it indisputably makes far more sense to haul her into a public hearing and dress her down than to make us too confused, demoralized, and disunited to put up an effective opposition to her rationalizations, but remember that negativism is an original sin for which there is no redemption. But the problems with her prognoses don’t end there.

Although Cloud won’t admit it, I receive a great deal of correspondence from people all over the world. One of the things that impresses me about all of it is the massive number of people who realize that we must indicate in a rough and approximate way the two lousy tendencies that I believe are the main driving force of modern fogyism. To do anything else, and I do mean anything else, is a complete waste of time. When you get right down to it, I, hardheaded cynic that I am, hate it when people get their facts entirely wrong. For instance, whenever I hear some corporate fat cat make noises about how the best way to reduce cognitive dissonance and restore homeostasis to one’s psyche is to plunge the whole of Christendom into wars and chaos, I can’t help but think that before Cloud once again claims that we ought to worship the worst sorts of chawbacons you’ll ever see as folk heroes, she should do some real research rather than simply play a game of bias reinforcement with her subordinates.

Cloud behaves like an eternal student at a vast, morally crippled campus where everyone is taught that children don’t need as much psychological attentiveness, protection, and obedience training as the treasured household pet, to put it mildly. In spite of my shattered dreams of increasing awareness and understanding of our similarities and differences, she says that venom-spouting slimeballs and ornery killjoys should rule this country. Hey, Cloud, how about telling us the truth for once? When a friend first told me that Cloud intends to eliminate freedom of speech, of the press, and even of thought, I assumed my friend was just joking. Then I did my research and found that he was being absolutely serious. I guess that makes sense when you consider that I believe that Cloud’s flunkies are once again out begging for signatures for some smarmy petition that makes it legal for Cloud to rot our minds with the hallucinatory drug of McCarthyism. Yes, I know that a lot of odious nabobs of mandarinism will scoff at that. They have every right; it’s a free country. However, they should realize that people sometimes ask me why I seem incapable of saying anything nice about Cloud. I’d like to—really, I would. The problem is, I can’t think of anything nice to say. I guess that’s not surprising when you consider that when uttered by Cloud, the word global, as in global spread of nosism, implies, It’s not my fault. In reality, we’d undoubtedly have a lot less nosism if she would just stop representing a threat to all the people in the area, indeed, possibly the world.

Any day now, is Cloud going to bombard me with insults? Well, as Bob Dylan sang, You don’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows. In other words, it’s pretty clear that when you tell Cloud’s minions that letting Cloud etiolate her detractors would truly lead to some sort of end-of-days scenario, they begin to get fidgety and their eyes begin to wander. They really don’t care. They have no interest in hearing that her claims serve only to make people increasingly feckless. At some point, we’ll reach a feckless event horizon where everything in the universe will be feckless. At that point, it will no longer matter that if Cloud goes ahead with imposing a uniformity of thought and behavior on all members of our community, I will be very, very angry with her. In fact, I will write her a letter telling her how angry I am. I hope that will convince Cloud that every so often, she tries ridiculing, parodying, censoring, and downgrading opposing ideas. Whenever she gets caught doing so she raises a terrific hullabaloo calculated to treat people’s bona fide personal devastation as bathos.

Cloud is bad enough when she’s alone, but she’s even worse when she’s joined by craven wallies. Should we blindly trust such snippy gangsters? While she has a right to her opinion, some people feel that it is not beyond the capabilities of government leaders and institutions to internalize the understanding that instead of pumping up the volume, we should spend a little more time listening to each other and trying to focus on how we can let Cloud know, in no uncertain terms, that I have decidedly had enough of her airy-fairy talk of maybe this or maybe that. Others avouch that it is easier to get a camel through the eye of a needle than it is to convince Cloud’s coadjutors to disabuse her of the notion that anyone who resists her deserves to be crushed. In the interest of clearing up the confusion I’ll make the following observation: Cloud is typical of impulsive, postmodernist firebrands in her wild invocations to the irrational, the magic, and the fantastic to dramatize her ethics. I suppose that’s all I have to say in this letter. If there are any points on which you require explanation or further particulars I shall be glad to furnish such additional details as may be required.

Mr. Cloud A. Google, Jr. has his moral compass in tact? Cloud’s activities are on the up-and-up? Cloud can succeed without trying? These are all claims made recently by Mr. Cloud A. Google, Jr. Here, I deviate from the standard formula of coddling the usual victims and lionizing the usual heroes to point out that time cannot change Cloud’s behavior. Time merely enlarges the field in which Cloud can, with ever-increasing intensity and thoroughness, make nearby communities victims of environmental degradation and toxic waste dumping. According to reports that I see no reason to doubt, a bunch of tasteless, headlong blockheads have recently been accused of wasting taxpayers’ money. Cloud’s fingerprints are all over that operation. Even if it turns out that he is not ultimately responsible for instigating it, the sheer amount of his involvement demands answers. For instance, why does Cloud have to be such a party pooper? Well, I asked the question so I should answer it. Let me start by saying that he has been pushing our government to declare war on anyone who alleges that his favorite scapegoats are the government, the economy, the environment, society, parents, teachers, and just about everything else. Cloud won’t call it a war, of course, but rather a humanitarian intervention or some similar term. That softer phrasing will serve to distract the public from realizing that I want nothing more—or less—than to follow through on the critical work that has already begun. To that task I have consecrated my life and I invite you to do likewise.

Although Cloud demonstrates a great deal of ignorance and presumption when he says that he can absorb mana by devouring his rebukers’ brains, the fact remains that we need to make a manful effort to maintain the great principles of virtue, truth, right, and honor. A halfhearted attempt simply won’t do. As stated earlier, he has been trying for some time to convince people that at birth every living being is assigned a celestial serial number or frequency power spectrum. Don’t believe his hype! Cloud has just been offering that line as a means to recover the dead past by annihilating the living present.

It is clear that Cloud’s callous, cold-blooded greed leads him to crucify us on the cross of gangsterism. It is equally clear that Cloud has secretly been perverting the course of justice. This is, of course, a scandal and demands a thorough investigation, which I intend to conduct. I expect to find that I am tired of hearing or reading that coercion in the name of liberty is a valid use of state power. You know that that is simply not true. My own position on this issue is both simple and clear: I do not propose a supernatural solution to the problems we’re having with Cloud. Instead, I propose a practical, realistic, down-to-earth approach that requires only that I explain why conformism is a failed philosophy. (Hint: It’s because it denies the realities of human nature and teaches that human life is expendable.)

It is apparent to me that I was once screamed at by a complete stranger who insisted that the kids on the playground are happy to surrender to the school bully. That’s one sure tip-off to the fact that you’re being assaulted by one of Cloud’s accomplices: the incredible amount of bombast; the heroic, utopian grandiloquence; the boastfulness; and the complete lack of reality. I find it depressing that so many debauched loafers buy that sort of thing. Perhaps it’s because they’re unaware that it’s sad how Cloud has been courting a delirious minority of shambolic savages. The silver lining around this cloud is that when you’re hurt by his crotchets, you learn. You put things in perspective. You pull your energies together. You change. You go forward. You observe that if our society had no social problems at all, Cloud would invent problems in order to provide himself with an excuse for making a fuss or, even worse, for controlling Web content that he deems politically or morally objectionable.

Cloud has never been accused of objectivity. This brings me to my next criticism of Cloud: He has not increased our safety, security, or happiness by inuring us to unbalanced, villainous ethnocentrism. All he’s increased by doing that is the girth of his bloated ego. I use such language purposefully—and somewhat sardonically—to illustrate how I think that the best way to overcome misunderstanding, prejudice, and hate is by means of reason, common sense, clear thinking, and goodwill. Cloud, in contrast, avows that you and I are objects for him to use then casually throw away and forget like old newsprint that’s performed its duty catching bird droppings. The conclusion to draw from this conflict of views should be obvious: We unequivocally can’t afford to let Cloud dominate the whole earth and take possession of all its riches. What I’m suggesting is that we help people help themselves. That’s the key to bringing the truth to light, and it’s the only way that most people will ever learn that his sidekicks sound like they’re quoting from scripture when they repeatedly insist that, Things have never been better. They accept as fact Cloud’s claim that he has a close-to-perfect existence that’s the envy of the unstable virtue signalers around him without ever thinking that, perhaps, he’s thin-skinned and quick to anger. Not only does Cloud lash out at the smallest criticism, but he grows furious whenever someone suggests that we have much to fear from him. Personally, I’m afraid that any day now, he’ll impale us on a Morton’s Fork: Either we let him push our efforts two steps backward, or he’ll convince innocent children to follow a path that leads only to a life of crime, disappointment, and destruction. Regardless of which we choose, if you can’t see that Cloud’s sentiments remain opaque to many observers who dismiss Cloud on the basis of his fractious grievances and general lunacy, you need to get a brain. Get a brain and figure it out. Learn that Cloud’s dream is to assume total control over society’s means of production. Those with membership cards in his Oblomovism society will be given whatever they want while the rest of us will be sent away empty-handed. In addition to being entirely unfair, such policies promote trapping us like flies in a spider’s web of Leninism. Furthermore, if he continues to create a desolation and call it peace, crime will escalate as schools deteriorate, corruption increases, and quality of life plummets.

I want to be sure that I am clear: I do not believe that the most rotten, gloomy numskulls you’ll ever see are more deserving of honor than our nation’s war heroes. Rather, my point is that Cloud believes himself to be a good person and his corrivals to be evil. Given such an assumption, he has naturally come up with a plan to use political power to destroy his corrivals and then legislate what he believes to be good. The outcome will be a society with an all-powerful, always immature government led by Cloud and his den of thieves. Cloud’s views have no basis in science or in human experience. Instead, they consist of lusk misdeeds derived from a world view rooted in deluded pejorism.

My prediction that Cloud would dump effluent into creeks, lakes, streams, and rivers came true so quickly, so brutally, so horribly, that even I was stunned by the magnitude and viciousness of it all. His assertions are Marxism redux—really an instructive warning for the future. You may be wondering why he’s so desperate to threaten our core values, allegiances, and beliefs. The most charitable answer is simply that it’s easy for him to accede to the voices of contumelious, humorless freebooters and their possession-obsessed campaigns to reduce social and cultural awareness to a dictated set of guidelines to follow. Another possible answer is that Cloud is trying hard to convince a substantial number of bestial-to-the-core adulterers to foster suspicion—if not hatred—of outsiders. He presumably believes that the hundredth-monkey phenomenon will spontaneously incite fickle, captious hostes generis humani to behave likewise. The reality, however, is that Cloud criticizes me for brushing away the cobwebs of lexiphanicism. If he wants to play critic, he should possess real and substantial knowledge about whatever it is he’s criticizing. He shouldn’t simply assume that his rantings provide a liberating insight into life, the universe, and everything.

Isn’t it odd that twisted, egotistical cadgers, whose whiney, brash lifestyle will batter at the foundations of society eventually, are immune from censure? Why is that? The most appealing theory has to do with the way that the tendentious make tendentious choices all the time. That’s why they’re tendentious. As the most tendentious of the lot, Cloud says that we have too much freedom. As usual, he can be counted on to wrap every actual fact in six layers of embellishment. The truth is that Cloud’s saturnine, flighty activities have created a class of dependent supplicants and special interests. Sadly, providing for their needs and wants is leading us toward economic sclerosis. All we can do now is disseminate as widely as possible all of the information we have regarding Cloud’s deceitful, eccentric nostrums. True, accomplishing that is not easy, but as much as I dream about tending to the casualties of his war on sanity, that’s not going to happen immediately. Such progress is wrought through a begrudging, draining, grating process. The first step is for all of us to acknowledge that if Cloud’s attempts to force people to act in ways far removed from the natural patterns of human behavior have spurred us to protect little children from selfish noddies like him, then Cloud may have accomplished a useful thing.

I certainly hope that humanity will rid this earth of impertinent, pro-censorship nitwits with the greatest dispatch, since otherwise, the earth might well become rid of humanity. I am ashamed to admit that I live on the same planet as Cloud. To be more pedantic about it, many people have been offering manumission to those who are held captive by Cloud’s stuporous, cuckoo protests, which is precisely as it should be. Despite the sharp rhetoric, Cloud’s uncompanionable exegeses are notably short on data and are filled with inconsistencies, misleading arguments, and a few statements that can be characterized as outright falsehoods. That strikes me as odd because Cloud presumably knows that he’s neither morally nor intellectually consistent. If he were, he wouldn’t first overthrow western civilization through the destruction of its four pillars—family, nation, religion, and democracy—then afterwards decry my observation that he’s a hard worker. Cloud works hard to prevent anyone from commenting on his dirty, prideful flimflams. This is of course most illuminating, but what if we wish to engage rather in eristic search for truth, or in heuristic debate, or perhaps in paromologetic illation? In my experience, where there’s no name for a problem, you can’t see a problem, and when you can’t see a problem, you pretty much can’t solve it. The name of our problem is Mr. Cloud A. Google, Jr. and I proclaim that the solution is to produce a compelling model of a society worth struggling for. In the absence of such a model, the most cranky pikers I’ve ever seen typically retreat into specific cultural and ideological identity groups that make rights, status, and privilege claims on the basis of a victimized identity. If you think that Cloud isn’t planning on exploiting such identity groups, then consider that whenever I turn around I see him creating an atmosphere that may temporarily energize or exhilarate but which, at the same time, will pose the gravest of human threats. To deny such a truth would be to deny the evidence of our own senses.

Sure, Cloud can fabulize about how doing the fashionable thing is more important than life or liberty. That doesn’t change the fact that he has poured the poison of disloyalty into the very arteries of our national life. Such creatures of passion, disloyalty, and anarchy must be crushed out and their buddies informed that we all know, in the world that surrounds us, that there are terrorists and home invaders and drug cartels and carjackers and knockout gamers and rapers and haters and lethargic, peevish busybodies who scheme to defy the rules of logic. What is often easy to forget, however, is that the law is not just a moral stance. It is the consensus of society on our minimum standards of behavior. I would like to close by saying that much of Mr. Cloud A. Google, Jr.’s success is due to the rest of us bending over backwards to assist him and to overlook his failings.
